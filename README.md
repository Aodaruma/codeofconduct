####Code for America's Code of Conduct

The Code for America community expects that Code for America network activities and events:

1. Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
2. Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
3. Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
4. Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
5. Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy. Use language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”
6. Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
7. Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Activities that aim to foster public use, not 8. private gain, are prioritized.
9. Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.
10. Work to ensure that all demographics present in the community are represented.
11. Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
12. Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.
13. Provide an environment where people are not subjected to discrimination or harassment.

Code for America reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in Code for America events or network activities.
